    <h2 id="about">About Rocky</h2>
    <p>Robert "Rocky" Balboa (born July 6, 1945[citation needed]) (also known by his ring name the Italian Stallion)
        is a fictional character and the titular protagonist of the Rocky film series. The character was created by
        Sylvester Stallone, who has also portrayed him in eight of the nine films in the franchise. He is depicted
        as a working class or poor Italian-American from the slums of Philadelphia who started out as a club fighter
        and "enforcer" for a local Philly Mafia loan shark. He is portrayed as overcoming the obstacles that had
        occurred in his life and in his career as a professional boxer.

        While the story of his first film was partly inspired by a 1975 fight between underdog Chuck Wepner and
        heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali (which nearly went the 15 round distance despite the odds), the
        inspiration for the name, iconography and fighting style came from boxing legend Rocco Francis "Rocky
        Marciano" Marchegiano, though his surname coincidentally also resembles that of Middleweight Boxing Champion
        Thomas Rocco "Rocky Graziano" Barbella.

        The character is widely considered to be Stallone's most iconic role and is often considered the role that
        started his film career. He received critical acclaim for his performance in the first movie, earning
        Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations. When Stallone reprised his role once again in 2015 for
        Creed, his performance received universal acclaim and he received his first Golden Globe Award for Best
        Supporting Actor, along with his third[1] Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, the National Board of
        Review Award for Best Supporting Actor and several other accolades.</p>
    <p>Robert "Rocky" Balboa was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on July 6, 1945.[citation needed] He was the
        only child in a Roman Catholic, Italian-American or Italian immigrant family.[a] Rocky appears to be fully
        or semi-fluent in the Italian language; when Rocky is spoken to in Italian by his priest, Father Carmine, it
        is apparent that Rocky understands the language very well or fluently, including in a scene in which he
        translates Italian into English for Tommy Gunn. However, despite Rocky's obvious understanding of Italian,
        it is unclear and undetermined how well he actually speaks the language, as his responses to Father Carmine
        are always in English.

        During the scene in Rocky in which Rocky takes Adrianna "Adrian" Pennino skating on Thanksgiving, he tells
        her, "Yeah – My old man, who was never the sharpest, told me I weren't born with much brain, so I better use
        my body." This encouraged him to take up boxing. He trained very hard so he could grow up to be like his
        idol Rocky Marciano. Unable to live on the low pay of club fights, and being unable to find work anywhere
        else, Rocky got a job as a collector for Tony Gazzo, the local loan shark, to make ends meet. By the end of
        1975, Rocky had fought in 64 fights, winning 43 (40 KOs) and losing 21. Rocky was proud that he never had
        his nose broken in any of his amateur fighting career. His nickname is the Italian Stallion, from his
        Italian-American heritage.</p>
    <p>The first film begins on November 25, 1975, in the slums of the Kensington section of Philadelphia. Rocky
        Balboa is fighting Spider Rico in a local boxing ring called the Cambria Fight Club (nicknamed "The Bucket
        of Blood") inside a chapel. In the second round, Rico hits Rocky with a headbutt, leaving a gash on his
        forehead. Rocky then delivers a vicious barrage of punches, knocking Rico out. The next day, Rocky stops by
        the J&M Tropical Fish pet shop, where he meets Adrian Pennino. Adrian is very shy and scared of Rocky's
        tough appearance, even though Rocky is kind to her and shows her respect. Afterward, Rocky goes to collect a
        loan for his loan shark boss, Tony Gazzo. Even though the client, Bob, does not have all the money, Rocky
        does not break his thumbs, despite Gazzo ordering him to do so. Later, Rocky stops by the local boxing gym
        and finds out that his locker has been replaced by another local contender. Unknown to him, the gym's owner
        and grizzled former boxer, Mickey Goldmill, does not dislike him, but considers Rocky's potential to be
        better than his effort. When Rocky leaves for home that night, he sees a young girl named Marie hanging
        around a bad crowd and walks her home. On the way, Rocky lectures her about staying away from the wrong
        people. However, once they get to her house, Marie assumes Rocky is trying to flirt with her, and dismisses
        him. Rocky walks home, frustrated how nothing is going right in his life.</p>
    <p>Rocky gets his dream come true when the undisputed World Heavyweight Champion, Apollo Creed, decides that he
        wants to give an unknown fighter a chance to fight for the title after his intended challenger, Mac Lee
        Green, broke his hand while training. Creed was told that no other contender was available for a fight on
        New Years Day. Going against his trainer's warnings of Rocky being a southpaw (left-handed boxer), Creed
        chooses Rocky because he likes Rocky's nickname, 'The Italian Stallion'.

        After getting picked by Creed, Rocky reunites with his estranged trainer, who convinces Rocky that he can
        help prepare him for the match. Mickey reveals that his career never got anywhere because he did not have a
        manager and he does not want the same thing to happen to Rocky. At the same time, Rocky begins dating
        Adrian. Rocky helps Adrian to become more self-confident and stand up for herself. Rocky confides in Adrian
        before the fight that, although he figures that he may not win, he wants to at least "go the distance".</p>
