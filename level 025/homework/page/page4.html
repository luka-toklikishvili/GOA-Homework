        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Batman, created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger, made his first appearance in *Detective Comics #27* in 1939.
            Bruce Wayne, a billionaire playboy, becomes Batman after witnessing the murder of his parents in a Gotham
            City alley. Swearing vengeance and justice, he fights crime using his wealth, intellect, and combat skills,
            all while dealing with his own internal struggles. Batman is often referred to as "The Dark Knight" for his
            shadowy presence and determination to fight against crime in a city rife with corruption and villains.</p>
