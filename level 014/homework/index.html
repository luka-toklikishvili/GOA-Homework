    <h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
    <p><b>Bruce Lee </b>(born November 27, 1940 – July 20, 1973) was a Hong Kong-American martial artist and actor. He
        was the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts philosophy drawing from different combat disciplines.
        Credited with helping popularize martial arts films in the 1970s,[3] Lee is considered by some commentators and
        martial artists to be the most influential martial artist of all time and a pop culture icon of the 20th
        century, who bridged the gap between East and West. He is credited with promoting Hong Kong action cinema and
        helping to change the way Chinese people were presented in American films.[4]

        Born in San Francisco and raised in British Hong Kong, Lee was introduced to the Hong Kong film industry as a
        child actor by his father.[5] His early martial arts experience included Wing Chun (trained under Ip Man), tai
        chi, boxing (winning a Hong Kong boxing tournament), and frequent street fighting (neighborhood and rooftop
        fights). In 1959, Lee moved to Seattle, where he enrolled at the University of Washington in 1961.[6] It was
        during this time in the United States that he began considering making money by teaching martial arts, even
        though he aspired to have a career in acting. He opened his first martial arts school, operated out of his home
        in Seattle. After later adding a second school in Oakland, California, he once drew significant attention at the
        1964 Long Beach International Karate Championships of California by making</p>
    <p>He developed Jeet Kune Do, a philosophy that emphasizes adaptability and fluidity in combat.</p>


    <h2 id="martial-arts">Martial Arts</h2>
    <p>Bruce Lee revolutionized martial arts with his approach, emphasizing practicality, speed, and efficiency Jeet
        Kune is a hybrid martial art conceived and practiced by martial artist Bruce Lee. It was formed from Lee's
        experiences in unarmed fighting and self-defense—as well as eclectic, Zen Buddhist and Taoist philosophies—as a
        new school of martial arts thought.

        At the heart of Jeet Kune Do lies the principle of intercepting the opponent's attacks, crafting responses or
        counterattacks that effectively target the adversary's offensive moves. JKD also incorporates a set of
        principles to help practitioners make instant decisions and improve the physical and mental self, being intended
        to have practical applications in life without the traditional routines and metaphysics of conventional martial
        arts.[15][16] As an eclectic martial art, it relies on a fighting style heavily influenced by Wing Chun, Tai
        Chi, taekwondo, boxing, fencing and jujutsu.

        Bruce Lee himself never formalized Jeet Kune Do before he died. This forced later JKD practitioners to rely upon
        their own interpretation of the philosophy created by Bruce Lee..</p>
