    <h1>Box modeling</h1>
    <p>Box modeling is a concept in web design and CSS that explains how the elements on a webpage are structured and
        how they take up space. Every element on a webpage is treated as a "box" (hence the term "box model"), and this
        box has several parts that define its size and position.</p>
