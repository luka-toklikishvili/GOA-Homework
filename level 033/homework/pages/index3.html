        <h3>margin</h3>
        <p>margin is the space outside an element. It pushes the element away from other elements around it.</p>

        <h3>padding</h3>
        <p>padding is the space inside an element, between its content (like text or images) and its border. It makes the content inside the box have some breathing room, so it doesn't touch the edges of the box.</p>
