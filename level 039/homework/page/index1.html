        <h2>Birds</h2>
        <p>Birds are warm-blooded vertebrates characterized by feathers, beaks, and the ability to lay eggs. They are known for their ability to fly, though some species, such as ostriches and penguins, are flightless. Birds are found all over the world, from the highest mountains to the deepest oceans.</p>
