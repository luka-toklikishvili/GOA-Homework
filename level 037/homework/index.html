        <h2>Habitat and Behavior</h2>
        <p>Sea horses are typically found in shallow waters, such as coral reefs, seagrass beds, and estuaries. They are
            excellent swimmers, but due to their small size and slow movement, they prefer to stay anchored to plants or
            coral using their tails.</p>

        <h2>Why Are Sea Horses Important?</h2>
        <p>Sea horses play a vital role in marine ecosystems by helping to control the populations of small crustaceans
            and other tiny creatures. They also contribute to the health of seagrass beds by helping to maintain their
            balance.</p>
