        <h2>What Are Mollusks?</h2>
        <p>Mollusks are a large and diverse group of invertebrates found in both marine and terrestrial environments.
            They belong to the phylum Mollusca and are characterized by their soft bodies, which are often protected by
            a hard shell.</p>

        <h2>Characteristics of Mollusks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Most mollusks have a soft body, which is often enclosed by a shell made of calcium carbonate.</li>
            <li>They typically have a muscular foot used for movement and a head with sensory organs.</li>
            <li>Many mollusks, such as snails and slugs, have a distinct spiral-shaped shell, while others like
                octopuses and squids lack a hard shell.</li>
            <li>Mollusks have a specialized organ called a mantle that secretes the shell in those species that possess
                one.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Mollusks</h2>
        <p>There are several different types of mollusks, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gastropods</strong> – The largest group, including snails, slugs, and limpets. They have a
                coiled or conical shell, and many are found on land or in freshwater environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Bivalves</strong> – These include clams, oysters, and mussels. They have two shells hinged
                together, and most live in marine or freshwater environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Cephalopods</strong> – This group includes octopuses, squids, and cuttlefish. They are known for
                their intelligence, ability to camouflage, and their lack of a traditional shell.</li>
            <li><strong>Polyplacophora</strong> – Also known as chitons, these mollusks have a series of overlapping
                plates along their back, providing protection.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Are Mollusks Important?</h2>
        <p>Mollusks play a critical role in many ecosystems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They are a significant food source for a wide variety of marine animals, including fish, birds, and even
                humans.</li>
            <li>Bivalves help filter water by feeding on plankton and small particles, improving water quality in their
                environments.</li>
            <li>Some mollusks, like snails, help break down organic material and recycle nutrients in terrestrial and
                marine ecosystems.</li>
            <li>Certain species, like the cuttlefish, have complex behaviors and intelligence that are of scientific
                interest for studies on cognition and learning.</li>
        </ul>
