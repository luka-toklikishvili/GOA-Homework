        <h2>What Are Whales?</h2>
        <p>Whales are large marine mammals found in oceans all around the world. They belong to the order Cetacea, which
            also includes dolphins and porpoises. Whales are known for their enormous size, intelligence, and complex
            behaviors.</p>

        <h2>Characteristics of Whales</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Whales are mammals, meaning they breathe air, give live birth, and nurse their young with milk.</li>
            <li>They have streamlined bodies that allow them to swim efficiently through the water.</li>
            <li>Whales communicate with each other using a variety of sounds, including songs, clicks, and whistles.
            </li>
            <li>They are warm-blooded, unlike fish, and have a layer of blubber that helps them stay warm in cold
                waters.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Whales</h2>
        <p>There are two main types of whales:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Baleen Whales</strong> – These whales, such as the blue whale and humpback whale, have baleen
                plates in their mouths that allow them to filter food, mainly small organisms like krill, from the
                water.</li>
            <li><strong>Toothed Whales</strong> – These whales, including sperm whales and orcas (killer whales), have
                teeth and are active hunters, feeding on fish, squid, and other marine animals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Are Whales Important?</h2>
        <p>Whales play a critical role in marine ecosystems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Whales help maintain the health of marine food chains by controlling the populations of fish and other
                marine animals.</li>
            <li>Their feces provide essential nutrients to the ocean, which promotes the growth of plankton – the base
                of the ocean food web.</li>
            <li>Whale carcasses provide an important food source for deep-sea creatures once they sink to the ocean
                floor.</li>
        </ul>
