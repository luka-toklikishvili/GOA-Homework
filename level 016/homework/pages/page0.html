    <h2 id="hero">The Hero</h2>
    <p><em> is a superhero in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and
            artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the
            Silver Age of Comic Books. He has been featured in comic books, television shows, films, video games,
            novels, and plays.

            Spider-Man is secret identity of Peter Benjamin Parker. Initially, Peter was depicted as a teenage
            high-school student and an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents,
            Richard and Mary Parker, died in a plane crash. Lee, Ditko, and later creators had the character deal with
            the struggles of adolescence and young adulthood and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash
            Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black
            Cat; and enemies such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin, and Venom. In his origin story, Peter gets his
            superhuman spider powers and abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. These powers include
            superhuman strength, agility, reflexes, stamina, durability, coordination, and balance; clinging to surfaces
            and ceilings like a spider; and detecting danger with his precognition ability called "spider-sense". He
            builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of his own design, which he
            uses both for fighting and travel, or webswing across the city. Peter Parker initially used his powers for
            his personal gain, but after his Uncle Ben was killed by a thief that Peter could not stop, he began to use
            his powers to fight crime by becoming Spider-Man.

            Before Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually
            relegated to the protagonist's sidekick role. The Spider-Man comic series broke ground by featuring Peter
            Parker, a high school student from the Queens borough of New York City, as Spider-Man's secret identity,
            whose "self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness" were issues to which young readers could
            relate. While Spider-Man was a quintessential sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes Bucky Barnes and Robin,
            Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman; he had learned the lesson for himself
            that "with great power comes great responsibility" —a line included in a text box in the final panel of the
            first Spider-Man's origin story, but later retroactively attributed to the late Uncle Ben Parker.

            Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series, the first and longest-lasting of which is The
            Amazing Spider-Man. Since his introduction, the main-continuity version of Peter has gone from a high school
            student to attending college to currently being somewhere in his late 20s. Peter has been a member of
            numerous superhero teams, most notably the Avengers and Fantastic Four. Doctor Octopus also took on the
            identity for a story arc spanning 2012–2014, following a body swap plot in which Peter appears to die.
            Marvel has also published comic books featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man, including Spider-Man 2099,
            which features the adventures of Miguel O'Hara, the Spider-Man of the future; Ultimate Spider-Man, which
            features the adventures of a teenage Peter Parker in the alternate universe; and Ultimate Comics:
            Spider-Man, which depicts a teenager named Miles Morales who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man after
            Ultimate Peter Parker's apparent death. Miles later became a superhero in his own right and was brought into
            mainstream continuity during the Secret Wars event, where he sometimes works alongside the mainline version
            of Peter.

            Spider-Man is one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes. He has appeared in countless
            forms of media, including several animated TV series: the first original animated series Spider-Man, with
            Paul Soles voicing the titular character, a live-action television series, syndicated newspaper comic
            strips, and multiple series of films. Spider-Man was first portrayed in live-action by Danny Seagren in
            Spidey Super Stories, a recurring skit on The Electric Company from 1974 to 1977. In live-action films,
            Spider-Man has been portrayed by actors Tobey Maguire in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, by Andrew Garfield
            in two films directed by Marc Webb, and in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by Tom Holland. Reeve Carney
            originally starred as Spider-Man in the 2010 Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark. Spider-Man was
            also voiced by Jake Johnson and Chris Pine in the animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, with the
            former reprising his role in the sequel, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. </em> </p>


    <h2 id="villains">Villains</h2>
    <p><em>As with Spider-Man, most of his villains' powers originate from scientific accidents or the misuse of
            scientific technology. They can be classified into multiple categories, such as animal-themed villains
            (Doctor Octopus, Vulture, Black Cat, Lizard, Rhino, Scorpion, Jackal, Beetle, Kangaroo, Tarantula, and
            Puma), villains with powers over the elements (Sandman, Electro, Molten Man, and Hydro-Man), horror-themed
            villains (the Green Goblin, the Hobgoblin, Morbius, Morlun, and the Symbiotes), crime lords (the Kingpin,
            Tombstone, Hammerhead, Silvermane, and Mister Negative),[1] inventors (the Shocker, the Tinkerer, Spencer
            Smythe, and Alistair Smythe), and masters of trickery and illusion (the Chameleon and Mysterio).[1] There
            are, however, numerous villains that don't fit into any specific category, such as Kraven the Hunter and
            Mephisto, the latter of whom originated as a Silver Surfer villain. The villains oftentimes form teams such
            as the Sinister Six to oppose the web-slinger.

            Spider-Man is notable for having numerous villains that redeemed themselves and became antiheroes, such as
            Black Cat, the Prowler, Morbius, Kraven, Sandman and Silver Sable. Also, unlike most superheroes, Spider-Man
            doesn't have one particular archenemy, but rather three: the Norman Osborn version of the Green Goblin, the
            Otto Octavius version of Doctor Octopus, and the Eddie Brock version of Venom, the latter two of whom have
            been similarly redeemed and depicted as antiheroes; since the late 2000s, the demon Mephisto has
            additionally been depicted as an overarching archenemy/prominent adversary of all incarnations of
            Spider-Man, responsible for Harry and Norman Osborn's transformations into the Green Goblin, creating
            Kindred, and manipulating various incarnations of Spider-Man into making deals with him: erasing Peter
            Parker's and Mary Jane Watson's marriage (and future daughter) from history, reverting Octavius from the
            Superior Spider-Man to a return to villainy, and tricking Miles Morales into sacrificing an innocent soul.

    <h2 id="powers">Powers</h2>
    <p> <em>Peter Parker has superhuman spider-powers and abilities derived from mutations resulting from the bite of a
            radioactive spider. Since the original Lee-Ditko stories, Spider-Man has had the ability to cling to walls.
            This has been speculated to be based on a distance-dependent interaction between his body and surfaces,
            known as the van der Waals force,though in the 2002 Spider-Man film, his hands and feet are lined with tiny
            clinging cilia in the manner of a real spider's feet. Spider-Man's other powers include superhuman strength,
            agility, and balance and a precognitive sixth sense referred to as his "spider-sense", which alerts him to
            danger.

            Spider-Man has a healing factor that allows him to recover from injuries sustained during battle.[114] In
            the aftermath of the 1989 "Acts of Vengeance" storyline, Spider-Man was said to have "superhuman
            recuperative abilities" that sped up his recovery from the exhaustion he suffered in defeating the
            Tri-Sentinel.

            The character was originally conceived by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko as intellectually gifted, and later
            writers have depicted his intellect at genius level. Academically brilliant, Peter has expertise in the
            fields of applied science, chemistry, physics, biology, engineering, mathematics, and mechanics.

            With his talents, he sews his own costume to conceal his identity, and he constructs many devices that
            complement his powers, most notably mechanical web-shooters that allow him to shoot webs, swing at high
            speeds throughout the city, and navigate and trap his enemies with his webs, additionally with a
            spider-signal as a flashlight and a warning beacon to criminals. Thomas Fireheart's scientists,
            world-renowned, are unable to replicate the fluid Parker created while in high school.
