    <h2 id="history">History of Georgia</h2>
    <p>The nation of Georgia (Georgian: საქართველო sakartvelo) was first unified as a kingdom under the Bagrationi
        dynasty by the King Bagrat III of Georgia in the early 11th century, arising from several successor states of
        the ancient kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia. The Kingdom of Georgia flourished during the 11th and 12th centuries
        under rulers such as King David IV the Builder and Queen Tamar the Great. The kingdom fell to the Mongol
        invasion by 1243, and after a restoration under George V the Brilliant it fell again to the Timurid Empire in
        1403. By 1490, Georgia was fragmented into several petty kingdoms and principalities, which throughout the Early
        Modern period struggled to maintain their autonomy against Ottoman and Iranian domination until Georgia was
        finally annexed by the Russian Empire in the 19th century. After a brief period of independence as Democratic
        Republic of Georgia, the country soon ended up being a Soviet Republic until the dissolution of the Soviet
        Union. The current republic of Georgia has been independent since 1991.</p>





    <h2 id="culture">Culture of Georgia</h2>
    <p>The Georgian alphabet is traditionally said to have been invented in the 3rd century BC and reformed by King
        Parnavaz I of Iberia in 284 BC. Most modern scholarship puts its origin date at some time in the 5th century AD,
        when the earliest examples can be found.

        Georgia's medieval culture was greatly influenced by Eastern Orthodox Christianity and the Georgian Orthodox and
        Apostolic Church, which promoted and often sponsored the creation of many works of religious devotion. These
        included churches and monasteries, works of art such as icons, and hagiographies of Georgian saints. In
        addition, many secular works of national history, mythology, and hagiography were also written.</p>


    <h2 id="geography">Geography of Georgia</h2>
    <p>Georgia is largely surrounded by the Greater Caucasus and Lesser Caucasus mountains, which form part of a natural
        boundary between Eastern Europe and West Asia. Because the Europe–Asia boundary is essentially a "historical and
        cultural construct",[8] Georgia's continental placement has varied greatly. Anaximander placed the boundary
        between Europe and Asia along the Phasis River (the modern Rioni River), which effectively located northern
        parts of Georgia in Europe and the south in Asia, a convention also followed by Herodotus.[9] According to one
        18th century definition, which set the Kuma–Manych Depression as the continental boundary, Georgia and the
        entire Caucasus fell into Asia. However, yet another definition drew the line at Aras River, effectively placing
        all of Georgia in Europe.[10]

        Notwithstanding variations in geographic placement, Georgia's proximity to the bulk of Europe, combined with
        various historical, cultural and political forces, has led to its inclusion in Europe. The country has joined
        European organizations, such as the Council of Europe and Eurocontrol, and was deemed eligible to apply for
        membership of the European Union,[11] which it did in 2022 and was recognized as a candidate</p>
