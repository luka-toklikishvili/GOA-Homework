            <h2 id="Batman">Batman: The Dark Knight</h2>
            <p>Batman[b] is a superhero who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. Batman was created
                by the artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and debuted in the 27th issue of the comic book Detective
                Comics on March 30, 1939. In the DC Universe, Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American
                playboy, philanthropist, and industrialist who resides in Gotham City. His origin story features him
                swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the murder of his parents, Thomas and Martha, as a
                child, a vendetta tempered by the ideal of justice. He trains himself physically and intellectually,
                crafts a bat-inspired persona, and monitors the Gotham streets at night. Kane, Finger, and other
                creators accompanied Batman with supporting characters, including his sidekicks Robin and Batgirl;
                allies Alfred Pennyworth and James Gordon; love interest Catwoman; and foes such as the Penguin, the
                Riddler, Two-Face, and his archenemy, the Joker.
                
                Kane conceived Batman in early 1939 to capitalize on the popularity of Superman; although Kane
                frequently claimed sole creation credit, Finger substantially developed the concept from a generic
                superhero into something more bat-like. They drew inspiration from pulp fiction characters like the
                Shadow and Sherlock Holmes. Batman received a spin-off publication, Batman, in 1940. Kane and Finger
                introduced Batman as a ruthless vigilante who frequently killed or maimed criminals, but he evolved into
                a just, tempered superhero with a stringent moral code that prohibits killing during the 1940s. Unlike
                most superheroes, Batman does not possess any superpowers, instead relying on his intellect, fighting
                skills, and wealth. The 1960s Batman television series used a camp aesthetic, which continued to be
                associated with Batman for years after it ended. Various creators worked to return Batman to his darker
                roots in the 1970s and 1980s, culminating with the 1986 miniseries The Dark Knight Returns by Frank
                Miller..</p>

            <p>Batman has no inherent superhuman powers; he relies on "his own scientific knowledge, detective skills,
                and athletic prowess".[60] Batman's inexhaustible wealth gives him access to advanced technologies, and
                as a proficient scientist, he is able to use and modify these technologies to his advantage. In the
                stories, Batman is regarded as one of the world's greatest detectives, if not the world's greatest crime
                solver.[61] Batman has been repeatedly described as having a genius-level intellect, being one of the
                greatest martial artists in the DC Universe, and having peak human physical and mental conditioning.[62]
                As a polymath, his knowledge and expertise in countless disciplines is nearly unparalleled by any other
                character in the DC Universe. He has shown prowess in assorted fields such as mathematics, biology,
                physics, chemistry, and several levels of engineering.[63] He has traveled the world acquiring the
                skills needed to aid him in his endeavors as Batman. In the Superman: Doomed story arc, Superman
                considers Batman to be one of the most brilliant minds on the planet.[64]

                Batman has trained extensively in various fighting styles, making him one of the best hand-to-hand
                fighters in the DC Universe. He possesses a photographic memory,[65] and has fully utilized his
                photographic memory to master a total of 127 forms of martial arts.[66] In terms of his physical
                condition, Batman is described as peak human and far beyond an Olympic-athlete-level condition, able to
                perform feats such as easily running across rooftops in a Parkour-esque fashion, pressing thousands of
                pounds regularly, and even bench pressing six hundred pounds of soil and coffin in a poisoned and
                starved state. Superman describes Batman as "the most dangerous man on Earth", able to defeat an entire
                team of superpowered extraterrestrials by himself in order to rescue his imprisoned teammates in Grant
                Morrison's first storyline in JLA.

                Batman is strongly disciplined, and he has the ability to function under great physical pain and resist
                most forms of telepathy and mind control. He is a master of disguise, multilingual, and an expert in
                espionage, often gathering information under the identity of a notorious gangster named Matches Malone.
                Batman is highly skilled in stealth movement and escapology, which allows him to appear and disappear at
                will and to break free of nearly inescapable deathtraps with little to no harm. He is also a master
                strategist, considered DC's greatest tactician, with numerous plans in preparation for almost any
                eventuality.

                Batman is an expert in interrogation techniques and his intimidating and frightening appearance alone is
                often all that is needed in getting information from suspects. Despite having the potential to harm his
                enemies, Batman's most defining characteristic is his strong commitment to justice and his reluctance to
                take a life. This unyielding moral rectitude has earned him the respect of several heroes in the DC
                Universe, most notably that of Superman and Wonder Woman.

                Among physical and other crime fighting related training, he is also proficient at other types of
                skills. Some of these include being a licensed pilot (in order to operate the Batplane), as well as
                being able to operate other types of machinery. In some publications, he even underwent some magician
                training..</p>

            <h2 id="Villains">Notable Villains</h2>
            <p>BBatman faces a variety of foes ranging from common criminals to outlandish supervillains. Many of them
                mirror aspects of the Batman's character and development, often having tragic origin stories that lead
                them to a life of crime.[46] These foes are commonly referred to as Batman's rogues gallery. Batman's
                "most implacable foe" is the Joker, a homicidal maniac with a clown-like appearance. The Joker is
                considered by critics to be his perfect adversary, since he is the antithesis of Batman in personality
                and appearance; the Joker has a maniacal demeanor with a colorful appearance, while Batman has a serious
                and resolute demeanor with a dark appearance. As a "personification of the irrational", the Joker
                represents "everything Batman [opposes]".[47] Other long-time recurring foes that are part of Batman's
                rogues gallery include Catwoman (a cat burglar anti-heroine who is variously an ally and romantic
                interest), the Penguin, Ra's al Ghul, Two-Face (Harvey Dent), the Riddler, the Scarecrow, Mr. Freeze,
                Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Bane, Clayface, and Killer Croc, among others. Many of Batman's adversaries
                are often psychiatric patients at Arkham Asylum.</p>
