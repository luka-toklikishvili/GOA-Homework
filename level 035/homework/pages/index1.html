        <h2>About Lions</h2>
        <p>Lions (Panthera leo) are large carnivorous mammals found in parts of Africa and India. They are known for their majestic manes and are often called "The Kings of the Jungle," although they mainly live in savannas and grasslands, not jungles.</p>
        
        <p>Lions live in social groups called prides, which consist of females, their cubs, and a few males. Lions are powerful hunters, but much of their hunting is done by the females of the pride. Male lions help protect the pride and their territory.</p>
        
        <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
        <p>Lions are large animals with strong bodies. Males typically weigh between 330-550 pounds, while females are slightly smaller. The males are distinguished by their long, thick manes, which protect their necks during fights.</p>
