                    Bruce Lee November 27, 1940 – July 20, 1973 was a Hong Kong-American martial artist, actor,
                    filmmaker, and philosopher. He was the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts philosophy
                    which was formed from Lee's experiences in unarmed fighting and self-defense—as well as eclectic,
                    Zen Buddhist and Taoist philosophies—as a new school of martial arts thought.With a film career
                    spanning Hong Kong and the United States, Li is regarded as the first global Chinese film star and
                    one of the most influential martial artists in the history of cinema. Known for his roles in five
                    feature-length martial arts films, Lee is credited with helping popularize martial arts films in the
                    1970s and promoting Hong Kong action cinema.

                    Born in San Francisco and raised in British Hong Kong, Lee was introduced to the Hong Kong film
                    industry as a child actor by his father. His early martial arts experience included Wing Chun
                    (trained under Ip Man), tai chi, boxing (winning a Hong Kong boxing tournament), and frequent street
                    fighting (neighborhood and rooftop fights). In 1959, Lee moved to Seattle, where he enrolled at the
                    University of Washington in 1961.[12] It was during this time in the United States that he began
                    considering making money by teaching martial arts, even though he aspired to have a career in
                    acting. He opened his first martial arts school, operated out of his home in Seattle. After later
                    adding a second school in Oakland, California, he once drew significant attention at the 1964 Long
                    Beach International Karate Championships of California by making demonstrations and speaking. He
                    subsequently moved to Los Angeles to teach, where his students included Chuck Norris, Sharon Tate,
                    and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

                    His roles in America, including playing Kato in The Green Hornet introduced him to American
                    audiences, but the cultural frictions that existed did not allow Lee to fully express himself. After
                    returning to Hong Kong in 1971, Lee landed his first leading role in The Big Boss, directed by Lo
                    Wei. A year later he starred in Fist of Fury, in which he portrayed Chen Zhen, and The Way of the
                    Dragon, directed and written by Lee. He went on to star in the US-Hong Kong co-production Enter the
                    Dragon (1973) and The Game of Death (1978).[13] His Hong Kong and Hollywood-produced films, all of
                    which were commercially successful, elevated Hong Kong martial arts films to a new level of
                    popularity and acclaim, sparking a surge of Western interest in Chinese martial arts. The direction
                    and tone of his films, including their fight choreography and diversification, dramatically
                    influenced and changed martial arts and martial arts films worldwide.[15] With his influence, kung
                    fu films began to displace the wuxia film genre—fights were choreographed more realistically,
                    fantasy elements were discarded for real-world conflicts, and the characterisation of the male lead
                    went from simply being a chivalrous hero to one that embodied the notion of masculinity.

                    Lee's career was cut short by his sudden death at age 33 from a brain edema. Nevertheless, his films
                    remained popular, gained a large cult following and became widely imitated and exploited. He became
                    an iconic figure known throughout the world, particularly among the Chinese, based upon his
                    portrayal of Cantonese culture in his films, and among Asian Americans for defying Asian stereotypes
                    in the United States. Since his death, Lee has continued to be a prominent influence on modern
                    combat sports, including judo, karate, mixed martial arts, and boxing, as well as modern popular
                    culture, including film, television, comics, animation, and video games. Time named Lee one of the
                    100 most important people of the 20th century.</em>

            <p><em>Lee's father Lee Hoi-chuen was a Cantonese opera star. As a result, Junior Lee was introduced to the
                    world of cinema at a very young age and appeared in several films as a child. Lee had his first role
                    as a baby who was carried onto the stage in the film Golden Gate Girl. He took his Chinese stage
                    name as 李小龍, lit. "Lee the Little Dragon", for the fact that he was born in both the hour and the
                    year of the Dragon by the Chinese zodiac.

                    As a nine-year-old, he co-starred with his father in The Kid in 1950, which was based on a comic
                    book character, "Kid Cheung", and was his first leading role. By the time he was 18, he had appeared
                    in 20 films.[26] After attending Tak Sun School (德信學校; several blocks from his home at 218 Nathan
                    Road, Kowloon), Lee entered the primary school division of the Catholic La Salle College at age 12.


                    Lee and Ip Man in 1958
                    In 1956, due to poor academic performance (and possibly poor conduct), he was transferred to St.
                    Francis Xavier's College, where he was mentored by Brother Edward Muss, F.M.S., a Bavarian-born
                    teacher and coach of the school boxing team. After Lee was involved in several street fights, his
                    parents decided that he needed to be trained in martial arts.[citation needed]

                    In 1953, Lee's friend William Cheung introduced him to Ip Man, but his European background on his
                    mother's side meant he was initially rejected from learning Wing Chun kung fu under him because of
                    the long-standing rule in the Chinese martial arts world not to teach foreigners.[additional
                    citation(s) needed] Cheung spoke on his behalf and Lee was accepted into the school and began
                    training in Wing Chun with Ip Man. Ip tried to keep his students from fighting in the street gangs
                    of Hong Kong by encouraging them to fight in organized competitions.

                    After a year of his training with Ip Man, most of the other students refused to train with Lee. They
                    had learned of his mixed ancestry, and the Chinese were generally against teaching their martial
                    arts techniques to non-Asians. Lee's sparring partner, Hawkins Cheung, states, "Probably fewer than
                    six people in the whole Wing Chun clan were personally taught, or even partly taught, by Ip Man".
                    However, Lee showed a keen interest in Wing Chun and continued to train privately with Ip Man,
                    William Cheung, and Wong Shun-leung.

                    In 1958, Lee won the Hong Kong schools boxing tournament, knocking out the previous champion, Gary
                    Elms, in the final. That year, Lee was also a cha-cha dancer, winning Hong Kong's Crown Colony
                    Cha-Cha Championship.</em></p>

            <p> <em>Lee's first introduction to martial arts was through his father, from whom he learned the
                    fundamentals of Wu-style tai chi. In his teens, Lee became involved in Hong Kong gang conflicts,
                    which led to frequent street fights. The largest influence on Lee's martial arts development was his
                    study of Wing Chun. Lee was 16 years old under the Wing Chun teacher Ip Man, between late 1956 and
                    1957, after losing to rival gang members.

                    Ip's regular classes generally consisted of form practice, chi sao (sticking hands) drills, wooden
                    dummy techniques, and free sparring. There was no set pattern for the classes. Other Chinese martial
                    arts styles Lee trained in were Northern Praying Mantis, Southern Praying Mantis, Eagle Claw, Tan
                    Tui, Law Hon, Mizongyi, Wa K'ung, Monkey, Southern Dragon, Fujian White Crane, Choy Li Fut, Hung
                    Gar, Choy Gar, Fut Gar, Mok Gar, Yau Kung Moon, Li Gar, and Lau Gar.

                    Lee was trained in boxing, between 1956 and 1958, by Brother Edward, coach of the St. Francis
                    Xavier's College boxing team. Lee went on to win the Hong Kong Schools boxing tournament in 1958
                    while scoring knockdowns against the previous champion Gary Elms in the final.[24] After moving to
                    the United States, Lee was heavily influenced by heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali, whose
                    footwork he studied and incorporated into his style in the 1960s.

                    Lee demonstrated his Jeet Kune Do martial arts at the Long Beach International Karate Championships
                    in 1964 and 1968, with the latter having higher-quality video footage available. Lee is seen
                    demonstrating quick eye strikes before his opponent can block and demonstrating the one-inch punch
                    on several volunteers. He demonstrates chi sao drills while blindfolded against an opponent, probing
                    for weaknesses in his opponent while scoring with punches and takedowns. Lee then participates in a
                    full-contact sparring bout against an opponent, with both wearing leather headgear.

                    Lee is seen implementing his Jeet Kune Do concept of economical motion, using Ali-inspired footwork
                    to keep out of range while counter-attacking with backfists and straight punches. He halts attacks
                    with stop-hit side kicks and quickly executes several sweeps and head kicks. The opponent repeatedly
                    attempts to attack Lee but is never able to connect with a clean hit. He once managed to come close
                    with a spin kick, but Lee counters it. The footage was reviewed by Black Belt magazine in 1995,
                    concluding that "the action is as fast and furious as anything in Lee's films."

                    It was at the 1964 championships that Lee first met taekwondo master Jhoongoo Rhee. While Rhee
                    taught Lee the side kick in detail, Lee taught Rhee the "non-telegraphic" punch. Rhee learned what
                    he calls the "accupunch" from Lee and incorporated it into American taekwondo. The "accupunch" is a
                    rapid fast punch that is very difficult to block, based on human reaction time—"the idea is to
                    finish the execution of the punch before the opponent can complete the brain-to-wrist
                    communication."

                    Lee commonly used the oblique kick, made popular much later in mixed martial arts. It is called the
                    jeet tek, "stop kick" or "intercepting kick", in Jeet Kune Do.</em>
