            <h2>about Christmas</h2>
            <p id="about Christmas"><em><b>Christmas</b> is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ,
                    observed primarily on December 25[a] as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of
                    people around the world. A feast central to the liturgical year in Christianity, it follows the
                    season of Advent (which begins four Sundays before) or the Nativity Fast, and initiates the season
                    of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night.
                    Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries, is celebrated religiously by a majority of
                    Christians, as well as culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the holiday
                    season surrounding it.

                    The traditional Christmas narrative recounted in the New Testament, known as the Nativity of Jesus,
                    says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies. When Joseph and Mary
                    arrived in the city, the inn had no room, and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child
                    was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds, who then spread the word.

                    There are different hypotheses regarding the date of Jesus's birth, and in the early fourth century,
                    the church fixed the date as December 25. It is exactly nine months after Annunciation on March 25,
                    also the date of the spring equinox. Most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian
                    calendar, which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in countries
                    throughout the world. However, part of the Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on
                    December 25 of the older Julian calendar, which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian
                    calendar. For Christians, believing that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the
                    sins of humanity rather than knowing Jesus's exact birth date is considered to be the primary
                    purpose of celebrating Christmas.

                    The customs associated with Christmas in various countries have a mix of pre-Christian, Christian,
                    and secular themes and origins. Popular holiday traditions include gift giving; completing an Advent
                    calendar or Advent wreath; Christmas music and caroling; watching Christmas movies; viewing a
                    Nativity play; an exchange of Christmas cards; attending church services; a special meal; and
                    displaying various Christmas decorations, including Christmas trees, Christmas lights, nativity
                    scenes, garlands, wreaths, mistletoe, and holly. Additionally, several related and often
                    interchangeable figures, known as Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, and Christkind, are
                    associated with bringing gifts to children during the Christmas season and have their own body of
                    traditions and lore. Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas festival involve
                    heightened economic activity, the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales period for
                    retailers and businesses. Over the past few centuries, Christmas has had a steadily growing economic
                    effect in many regions of the world.</em></p>

            <h2>History of christmas</h2>
            <p> <em>In the 2nd century, the "earliest church records" indicate that "Christians were remembering and
                    celebrating the birth of the Lord", an "observance [that] sprang up organically from the authentic
                    devotion of ordinary believers"; although "they did not agree upon a set date". The earliest
                    evidence of Christ's birth being marked on December 25 is a sentence in the Chronograph of 354.
                    Liturgical historians generally agree that this part of the text was written in Rome in AD 336.[22]
                    Though Christmas did not appear on the lists of festivals given by the early Christian writers
                    Irenaeus and Tertullian,[4] the early Church Fathers John Chrysostom, Augustine of Hippo, and Jerome
                    attested to December 25 as the date of Christmas toward the end of the fourth century.[20] December
                    25 was the traditional date of the winter solstice in the Roman Empire,[24] where most Christians
                    lived, and the Roman festival Dies Natalis Solis Invicti (birthday of Sol Invictus, the 'Invincible
                    Sun') had been held on this date since 274 AD.[25]

                    In the East, the birth of Jesus was celebrated in connection with the Epiphany on January 6.[26][27]
                    This holiday was not primarily about Christ's birth, but rather his baptism.[28] Christmas was
                    promoted in the East as part of the revival of Orthodox Christianity that followed the death of the
                    pro-Arian Emperor Valens at the Battle of Adrianople in 378. The feast was introduced in
                    Constantinople in 379, in Antioch by John Chrysostom towards the end of the fourth century,[27]
                    probably in 388, and in Alexandria in the following century.[29] The Georgian Iadgari demonstrates
                    that Christmas was celebrated in Jerusalem by the sixth century.[30]


                    The Nativity, from a 14th-century missal, a liturgical book containing texts and music necessary for
                    the celebration of Mass throughout the year
                    In the Early Middle Ages, Christmas Day was overshadowed by Epiphany, which in western Christianity
                    focused on the visit of the magi. However, the medieval calendar was dominated by Christmas-related
                    holidays. The forty days before Christmas became the "forty days of St. Martin" (which began on
                    November 11, the feast of St. Martin of Tours), now known as Advent.[31] In Italy, former
                    Saturnalian traditions were attached to Advent.[31] Around the 12th century, these traditions
                    transferred again to the Twelve Days of Christmas (december 25 – January 5); a time that appears in
                    the liturgical calendars as Christmastide or Twelve Holy Days.

                    In 567, the Council of Tours put in place the season of Christmastide, proclaiming "the twelve days
                    from Christmas to Epiphany as a sacred and festive season, and established the duty of Advent
                    fasting in preparation for the feast."[32] This was done in order to solve the "administrative
                    problem for the Roman Empire as it tried to coordinate the solar Julian calendar with the lunar
                    calendars of its provinces in the east."

                    The prominence of Christmas Day increased gradually after Charlemagne was crowned Emperor on
                    Christmas Day in 800. Edmund the Martyr was anointed on Christmas in 855 and King William I of
                    England was crowned on Christmas Day 1066.


                    The coronation of Charlemagne on Christmas of 800 helped promote the popularity of the holiday
                    By the High Middle Ages, the holiday had become so prominent that chroniclers routinely noted where
                    various magnates celebrated Christmas. King Richard II of England hosted a Christmas feast in 1377
                    at which 28 oxen and 300 sheep were eaten.[31] The Yule boar was a common feature of medieval
                    Christmas feasts. Caroling also became popular, and was originally performed by a group of dancers
                    who sang. The group was composed of a lead singer and a ring of dancers that provided the chorus.
                    Various writers of the time condemned caroling as lewd, indicating that the unruly traditions of
                    Saturnalia and Yule may have continued in this form. "Misrule"—drunkenness, promiscuity,
                    gambling—was also an important aspect of the festival. In England, gifts were exchanged on New
                    Year's Day, and there was special Christmas ale.

                    Christmas during the Middle Ages was a public festival that incorporated ivy, holly, and other
                    evergreens. Christmas gift-giving during the Middle Ages was usually between people with legal
                    relationships, such as tenant and landlord. The annual indulgence in eating, dancing, singing,
                    sporting, and card playing escalated in England, and by the 17th century the Christmas season
                    featured lavish dinners, elaborate masques, and pageants. In 1607, King James I insisted that a play
                    be acted on Christmas night and that the court indulge in games.It was during the Reformation in
                    16th–17th-century Europe that many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or
                    Christkindl, and the date of giving gifts changed from December 6 to Christmas Eve.</em></p>
