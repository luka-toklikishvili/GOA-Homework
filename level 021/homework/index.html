            <h2>about Christmas </h2>
            <p class="p1" id="about Christmas">The Christmas season or the festive season; also known as the holiday
                season or the holidays,
                is an annual period generally spanning from late November or December to early January. Incorporating
                Christmas Day and New Year's Day, the various celebrations during this time create a peak season for the
                retail sector (Christmas/holiday "shopping season") extending to the end of the period ("January
                sales"). Christmas window displays and Christmas tree lighting ceremonies are customary traditions in
                various locales.

                In Western Christianity, the Christmas season is traditionally synonymous with Christmastide, which runs
                from December 25 (Christmas Day) to January 5 (Twelfth Night or Epiphany Eve), popularly known as the 12
                Days of Christmas. As the economic impact involving the anticipatory lead-up to Christmas Day grew in
                America and Europe into the 19th and 20th centuries, the term "Christmas season" began to also encompass
                the liturgical Advent season, the period observed in Western Christianity from the fourth Sunday before
                Christmas Day until Christmas Eve. The term "Advent calendar" continues to be widely known in Western
                parlance as a term referring to a countdown to Christmas Day from the beginning of December (although in
                retail planning the countdown to Christmas usually begins at the end of the summer season, and the
                beginning of September).

                Beginning in the mid-20th century, as the Christian-associated Christmas holiday and liturgical season,
                in some circles, became increasingly commercialized and central to American economics and culture while
                religio-multicultural sensitivity rose, generic references to the season that omitted the word
                "Christmas" became more common in the corporate and public sphere of the United States, which has caused
                a semantics controversy that continues to the present. By the late 20th century, the Jewish holiday of
                Hanukkah and the new African American cultural holiday of Kwanzaa began to be considered in the U.S. as
                being part of the "holiday season", a term that as of 2013 had become equally or more prevalent than
                "Christmas season" in U.S. sources to refer to the end-of-the-year festive period. "Holiday season" has
                also spread in varying degrees to Canada;however, in the United Kingdom and Ireland, the phrase "holiday
                season" has been the subject of some controversy.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p class="p2" id="History">In the 2nd century, the "earliest church records" indicate that "Christians were
                remembering
                and celebrating the birth of the Lord", an "observance [that] sprang up organically from the authentic
                devotion of ordinary believers"; although "they did not agree upon a set date". The earliest evidence of
                Christ's birth being marked on December 25 is a sentence in the Chronograph of 354. Liturgical
                historians generally agree that this part of the text was written in Rome in AD 336. Though Christmas
                did not appear on the lists of festivals given by the early Christian writers Irenaeus and Tertullian
                the early Church Fathers John Chrysostom, Augustine of Hippo, and Jerome attested to December 25 as the
                date of Christmas toward the end of the fourth century.] December 25 was the traditional date of the
                winter solstice in the Roman Empire, where most Christians lived, and the Roman festival Dies Natalis
                Solis Invicti (birthday of Sol Invictus, the 'Invincible Sun') had been held on this date since 274 AD.

                In the East, the birth of Jesus was celebrated in connection with the Epiphany on January 6. This
                holiday was not primarily about Christ's birth, but rather his baptism. Christmas was promoted in the
                East as part of the revival of Orthodox Christianity that followed the death of the pro-Arian Emperor
                Valens at the Battle of Adrianople in 378. The feast was introduced in Constantinople in 379, in Antioch
                by John Chrysostom towards the end of the fourth century,probably in 388, and in Alexandria in the
                following century.[The Georgian Iadgari demonstrates that Christmas was celebrated in Jerusalem by the
                sixth century.


                The Nativity, from a 14th-century missal, a liturgical book containing texts and music necessary for the
                celebration of Mass throughout the year
                In the Early Middle Ages, Christmas Day was overshadowed by Epiphany, which in western Christianity
                focused on the visit of the magi. However, the medieval calendar was dominated by Christmas-related
                holidays. The forty days before Christmas became the "forty days of St. Martin" (which began on November
                11, the feast of St. Martin of Tours), now known as Advent. In Italy, former Saturnalian traditions were
                attached to Advent.[31] Around the 12th century, these traditions transferred again to the Twelve Days
                of Christmas (December 25 – January 5); a tim that appears in the liturgical calendars as Christmastide
                or Twelve Holy Days.

                In 567, the Council of Tours put in place the season of Christmastide, proclaiming "the twelve days from
                Christmas to Epiphany as a sacred and festive season, and established the duty of Advent fasting in
                preparation for the feast." This was done in order to solve the "administrative problem for the Roman
                Empire as it tried to coordinate the solar Julian calendar with the lunar calendars of its provinces in
                the east."

                The prominence of Christmas Day increased gradually after Charlemagne was crowned Emperor on Christmas
                Day in 800. King Edmund the Martyr was anointed on Christmas in 855 and King William I of England was
                crowned on Christmas Day 1066.


                The coronation of Charlemagne on Christmas of 800 helped promote the popularity of the holiday
                By the High Middle Ages, the holiday had become so prominent that chroniclers routinely noted where
                various magnates celebrated Christmas. King Richard II of England hosted a Christmas feast in 1377 at
                which 28 oxen and 300 sheep were eaten.The Yule boar was a common feature of medieval Christmas feasts.
                Caroling also became popular, and was originally performed by a group of dancers who sang. The group was
                composed of a lead singer and a ring of dancers that provided the chorus. Various writers of the time
                condemned caroling as lewd, indicating that the unruly traditions of Saturnalia and Yule may have
                continued in this form.[31] "Misrule"—drunkenness, promiscuity, gambling—was also an important aspect of
                the festival. In England, gifts were exchanged on New Year's Day, and there was special Christmas ale.

                Christmas during the Middle Ages was a public festival that incorporated ivy, holly, and other
                evergreens.Christmas gift-giving during the Middle Ages was usually between people with legal
                relationships, such as tenant and landlord. The annual indulgence in eating, dancing, singing, sporting,
                and card playing escalated in England, and by the 17th century the Christmas season featured lavish
                dinners, elaborate masques, and pageants. In 1607, King James I insisted that a play be acted on
                Christmas night and that the court indulge in games.It was during the Reformation in 16th–17th-century
                Europe that many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or Christkindl, and the date
                of giving gifts changed from December 6 to Christmas Eve.</p>
