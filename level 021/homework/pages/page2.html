            <h2>History of McDonald's</h2>
            <p>McDonald's was founded in 1940 by Richard and Maurice McDonald in San Bernardino, California. Initially,
                it was a drive-in restaurant serving hamburgers, fries, and milkshakes. In 1954, Ray Kroc, a
                businessman, partnered with the McDonald brothers to expand the brand. By 1955, Kroc had opened the
                first McDonald's franchise in Des Plaines, Illinois, which marked the beginning of McDonald's global
                expansion.</p>
            <p>Today, McDonald's operates over 40,000 locations worldwide, making it the largest fast-food chain in
                terms of revenue and number of locations.</p>
