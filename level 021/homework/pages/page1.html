            <h2>About Demon slayer</h2>
            <p class="p1" id="plot"><em>Tanjiro Kamado is a kind-hearted and intelligent boy who lives with his family
                    in the mountains. After his father's death, he became his family's breadwinner and travels to the
                    nearby village to sell charcoal. One day, Tanjiro comes home to discover his family was slaughtered
                    by a demon. His sister Nezuko is the sole survivor of the incident; though she has been transformed
                    into a demon, Nezuko still shows signs of human emotion and thought. Following an encounter with
                    Giyu Tomioka, the Water Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Tanjiro is sent to train with Giyu's
                    former instructor Sakonji Urokodaki in becoming a Demon Slayer and begins his quest to help Nezuko
                    turn into a human again.

                    Two years later, Tanjiro learns the "Water Breathing" style and takes part in a formidable exam. He
                    is one of the few to pass, officially making him a member of the Corps. Sakonji has hypnotized
                    Nezuko to not harm humans and she aids Tanjiro in dire situations as he starts his work of hunting
                    down and slaying demons. One of their assignments bring them to Asakusa where they encounter Muzan
                    Kibutsuji, the progenitor of all demons and the one responsible for the murder of their family.
                    Tanjiro and Nezuko also meet Tamayo and Yushiro, two demons free from Muzan's control. They ally to
                    develop a cure for Nezuko, though it will require Tanjiro to supply Tamayo with blood samples from
                    the Twelve Kizuki, the twelve most powerful demons under Muzan's command, split into the six Lower
                    Ranks and the six Upper Ranks.

                    Along their journey, Tanjiro and Nezuko meet fellow Demon Slayers Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke
                    Hashibira; they team up after Tanjiro's mission to kill Kyogai, the former Lower Six. They later
                    join other Demon Slayers in facing the family of Lower Five Rui. In the midst of battle, Tanjiro
                    unlocks a mysterious Breathing Style known as "Hinokami Kagura", but Rui ultimately outmatches him,
                    while Inosuke and Zenitsu are injured and the expedition is slaughtered. Giyu and Insect Hashira
                    Shinobu Kocho rescue the survivors, who are brought back to the Corps' headquarters. Tanjiro is put
                    on trial by the Hashira – Giyu, Shinobu, Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku, Sound Hashira Tengen Uzui,
                    Love Hashira Mitsuri Kanroji, Stone Hashira Gyomei Himejima, Mist Hashira Muichiro Tokito, Serpent
                    Hashira Obanai Iguro, and Wind Hashira Sanemi Shinazugawa – who, with the exception of Giyu and
                    Mitsuri, do not believe he and Nezuko should be allowed to live. Nonetheless, the Corps' leader
                    Kagaya Ubuyashiki, is able to convince them to accept Nezuko and see Tanjiro's importance, believing
                    it is with their help that Muzan can be defeated.

                    Angered by Rui's death, Muzan kills the Lower Ranks due to their constant failures; he spares Lower
                    One Enmu and tasks him with killing Tanjiro. After a battle against Enmu in a passenger train,
                    Tanjiro kills him with Kyojuro's support. However, Upper Three Akaza appears and battles Kyojuro,
                    who dies from his wounds as the demon escapes. Months later, the group is sent to Yoshiwara with
                    Tengen, where they face off and kill the Upper Six siblings Gyutaro and Daki. Tengen retires from
                    the Corps after suffering extensive injuries. During another battle at the Swordsmith Village, where
                    the Corps' weapons are forged, Tanjiro meets Sanemi's younger brother Genya, who has the mysterious
                    ability to temporarily gain demonic powers after eating their flesh. With the help of Muichiro and
                    Mitsuri, the group kill Upper Five Gyokko and Upper Four Hantengu. In the aftermath, they discover
                    that Nezuko is immune to sunlight. She becomes Muzan's prime target as he has long sought a way to
                    overcome the sun and become immortal. Tanjiro also learns his Hinokami Kagura descends from "Sun
                    Breathing", the first Breathing Style created by Yoriichi Tsugikuni, the most powerful Demon Slayer
                    in history, and develops it to fight Muzan.

                    Knowing Muzan will attempt to find Nezuko, the Corps enacts strict training to prepare its members
                    for the coming conflict. Tamayo develops a serum with the obtained blood samples to cure Nezuko, who
                    is kept in isolation as she recovers. Muzan appears and Kagaya triggers a suicide attack to stagger
                    him. The Hashira ambush Muzan but he traps them all within the Infinity Castle, an endless labyrinth
                    housing Akaza, Upper Two Doma, Upper One Kokushibo, and the newly-ascended members Kaigaku and
                    Nakime: Zenitsu's former partner and Muzan's personal assistant respectively. As Zenitsu kills
                    Kaigaku, Tamayo injects Muzan with a poison she and Shinobu have made to weaken his abilities. When
                    Akaza remembers his human life, he betrays Muzan and commits suicide, while Shinobu sacrifices
                    herself to poison Doma, allowing her protégé Kanao Tsuyuri and Inosuke to kill him. After a
                    harrowing battle, Kokushibo kills both Muichiro and Genya before being killed as well. Muzan kills
                    Tamayo, and later Nakime when she is hypnotized by Yushiro to use her powers against him, but he is
                    forced above ground by the Corps.

                    Aided by Tamayo's poison, the Corps unleash a desperate battle of attrition as the remaining members
                    fight to stall Muzan until the morning sun can kill him. Muzan is left helpless against the sun but
                    Gyomei, Obanai, and Mitsuri succumb to their injuries. As Tanjiro delivers the final blow, Muzan
                    fatally wounds him and forcefully gives him his remaining blood. Tanjiro is transformed into a demon
                    as Muzan's last-ditch effort to have his species survive. He begins to attack the survivors but
                    through their efforts and Nezuko's aid, who has been fully restored to her human self, the
                    transformation is reversed. In the aftermath of the battle, the Corps are disbanded, leaving Giyu
                    and Sanemi as the last surviving Hashira.

                    Muzan's death has effectively vanquished all demons under his control while Yushiro goes to live as
                    a painter. Tanjiro and Nezuko return to their home, accompanied by Zenitsu and Inosuke. Tanjiro and
                    Inosuke marry Kanao and fellow Demon Slayer Aoi Kanzaki, respectively, while Zenitsu marries Nezuko.
                    In a modern-day epilogue, the descendants and reincarnations of the Corps members enjoy a peaceful
                    life free of demons.</em></p>

                    The Mist Hashira, whose aloof demeanour hides a fierce rage against demons. After his older twin
                    brother was killed protecting him from a demon, he suffers survivor's guilt, which his relationship
                    with Tanjiro helps him to cope with. Furthermore, he had become amnesiac and lost his childhood
                    memories, which are restored once he realizes that Tanjiro has the same red eyes as his father.
                    During the attack on the Swordsmith Village, he defeats Gyokko. Muichiro is killed in the battle
                    against Kokushibo, who is revealed to be his distant ancestor. In the Reiwa era, he and his brother
                    are reincarnated as infant twins.</p>

            <p>Voiced by: Satoshi Hino,Mariya Ise (child) (Japanese); Mark Whitten, Ryan Bartley (child) (English)
                The Flame Hashira and successor to his father Shinjuro. Though he comes off as boisterous and eccentric,
                he is pure-hearted and honorable, as his mother instilled in him a moral code of protecting the weak. He
                is assigned to investigate the Mugen Train, with Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke, and Nezuko aiding him in
                dispatching Enmu. After the battle, Akaza confronts him and proposes that he turn into a demon, having
                recognized his skill and strength. Kyojuro rejects this and battles him, but is ultimately killed. In
                his last moments, he directs Tanjiro to Shinjuro. Tanjiro later has the tsuba of Kyojuro's sword
                installed into his new sword to honor him. In the Reiwa Era, he is reincarnated as a high school student
                named Tojuro.</p>

                The Water Hashira and the first Demon Slayer that Tanjiro meets. He initially tries to kill Nezuko but
                reconsiders after she protects Tanjiro from him, and directs them to his mentor Sakonji Urokodaki in
                hopes that Tanjiro could succeed him and possibly cure Nezuko. Beneath his aloof and unemotional
                exterior, he suffers from an inferiority complex stemming from survivor's guilt during Final Selection
                and does not believe he is a true Hashira. He developed an additional self-taught form of Water
                Breathing. Giyu and Tanjiro battle Akaza in the Infinity Castle, and later are the first to face Muzan.
                He loses his left arm during the battle, but survives. In the Reiwa Era, Giyu's reincarnation is a child
                named Giichi, who is close friends with Sabito and Makomo's reincarnations.</p>
